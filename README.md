### Definitions

#### class()
A class is an essential part of OOP.
Classes are the cookie cutters for objects/instances
It groups methods so that the cookie cutter can select what charateristics we want for the objects/instances

#### self
Self refers to the instance on which the method is being called

#### instance
It is a specific example of the class. It is NOT the class!

#### Methods
Are functions that can be used by an object of a specific class

### Abstraction
Is hiding complexity from the end user and exposing only usefull/nesscisary parts to get somthing done.

An example would be turging on a microwave using the start function. The user doesnt need to know about particle vibrations and resonance. They just need to know that the food heats up.

### Inheritance
The ability to inherit behavaoiurs and chateristics from a parent class.
